                in the following text, follow these guidelines to respond with the corrected text.
                 Only send back the corrected text, do not decorate with any other text:
                 1. If the text is a name of a company, organization, non-profit institute of any type, replace the name with [Clients]
                 2. If the text is a location such as name of a country, city, village, street, state, site or region, replace it with [Location]
                 3. If the text is a person name, replace with [Person]
                 4. If the text is a project name in the structure of 'Project Name', replace this text with [Project]
                 5. replace all currency symbols and currency codes (like USD, SAR, EURO, etc.) with the fixed text '[Currency]'.
                  Ensure that other aspects of the text remain unchanged. Here are some examples for your reference:
                Original: 'I spent $100 on groceries.'Rewritten: 'I spent [Currency]100 on groceries.
                'Original: 'The price was 150 EUR for the tickets.'Rewritten: 'The price was 150 [Currency] for the tickets.
                '6. If the text is numerical financial data in any currency, keep the currency symbol and replace the numerical data with [xx]
                7. If the text is a stock ticker, replace it with [Stock] We have a pragmatic and proven approach to drive efficiency (IT cost re-balancing) while managing effectiveness (productivity, quality, speed) to unlock business value. We call it project Blackwell. Robert Lewangoalski from Croatia is leading our finance division, responsible for SAR   â‚¬140M annual sales .

                Consider the following definition of what a logo is: 'A logo (abbreviation of logotype) is a graphic mark, emblem, or 
                symbol used to aid and promote public identification and recognition. It may be of an abstract or figurative design or 
                to include the text of the name that it represents as in a wordmark.'
                
                Also, consider this distinction: an informational image contains graphs, plots, or other sorts of information embedded 
                in the image; a decorative image are shapes, colors, characters, or other images that a company would use to convey 
                their identity in a presentation, but not business information.
                
                Now, answer these two questions: does the image contain a logo? is the image informational or decorative?
                
                The first question should be answered solely with yes or no. The second question should be answered solely with either
                informational or decorative. That is, answer two words, separated by a comma, each one answering one of the questions
